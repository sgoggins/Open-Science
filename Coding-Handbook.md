| Code Name | Code Description |
|---|---|
| 1. Project| Measures - goals - challenges - prior successes |
|---|---|
| a. Goals and Objectives | The objective or goal that the project has identified. May or may not be in response to a challenge the project has identified. For example, if the project identifies memory usage as a challenge for their software, software development to improve memory usage would be coded as a project goal. |
| b. Challenges | Challenges that the project has identified. These may or may not be used to describe the need for funding. |
| c. Prior Success | Projects identify their previous successful outcomes. Funding request may be to build on this success, or it may be an indicator that no funding is needed for this area. |
| 2. Project Type | Base on CZI project types - Biomedical or Foundational to all scientific research |
|---|---|
| a. Foundational | The project is foundational to all scientific research: 1) ML/Data analysis, 2) Visualization, and 3) Data management/workflows|
| b. Domain Specific | The project is specific to Biomedical Research |
| 3. Project Activity| Project Key Activities|
|---|---|
| a. New Piece of Software | The project is building a new piece of software (standalone). |
| b. Software Improvement| The project is building a new feature within an existing piece of software. The project is improving functionality of an existing piece of software. This code may appear as a challenge, development activity, or as a goal to improve. Includes such things as optimization, scale, memory usage, and improving installation, and automation. Renamed from - New Software Feature and Merged to include improvements |
| c. Software Maintenance | The ongoing maintenance of a project. This may include many ongoing activities, but common activities could include fixing bugs, and maintaining software interdependencies, and software testing. |
| d. Open Sourcing | The project is creating an open source version of an existing piece of proprietary software. The project is concerned with licensing. |
| e. Documentation | he project may or may not have good documentation. This may appear as a challenge, development activity, or as a goal to improve. This could include website infrastructure design. |
| f. Community Outreach | Activity with new and existing contributors and users for the purpose of promotion or external coordination – blogs, workshops, hackathons, training, requirements gathering. |
| g. Data Creation or Standardization | A primary purpose of the project is the creation or management of data or data standards. Metadata, data management, and the exchange of information by scientists OR, across software tools. This can be proprietary or open data.  |
| h. Project Coordination | Internal and external project communication and governance. May be associated with a community manager.|
| i. Repository Management | Activities associated with the maintenance and management of the project’s software and documentation repositories. |
| j. Project Measurement | Measuring project impact and productivity to improve the project. |
| k. Research Activity | Conduct research based on project and publish papers and present research at conferences.|
| 4. Existing Resources | Resource the project has identified (often connected to prior success)|
|---|---|
| a. Existing Software | The project has or has built software for a scientific purpose. This can include descriptions and technical specifications for existing software or digital assets. |
| b. Existing Facilities, Hardware, and Equipment | Labs, offices, servers, and equipment. Examples of this could include personal computers and servers. This can include descriptions and technical specifications for existing physical assets. |
| c. Existing Paid Contributors| Work was done or is being done by paid contributors |
| d. Existing Financial Support| The project has or has had prior financial support. Examples of this may travel, or any other miscellaneous expenses that are not explicitly stated as people or facilities and hardware expenses. |
|5. Project Funding Requests| Money that the project is explicitly asking for in the proposal|
|---|---|
| a. Request for Facilities, Hardware, and Equipment | The project requests funding for hardware that enables the project to run. Examples of this could include personal computers and servers |
| b. Funding for Salaried Position | The project is requesting money for paid contributors. |
| c. Request for Travel Funding | The project is requesting funds for travel. |
|6. D&I | The Proposal mentions diversity and inclusion issues. This is being capture for future coding work. D&I has a seperate code book |
